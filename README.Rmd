## Overview

**squashinformr** allows users to easily scrape <a href="http://www.squashinfo.com/" target="_blank">SquashInfo</a> for data on the Professional Squash Association World Tour and other squash tournaments. The functions within this package scrape, parse, and clean data associated with players, tournaments, and rankings.

## Installation

Install the development version of `squashinformr` from this GitHub repository via:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("HaydenMacDonald/squashinformr")
```

## Usage

There are three major families of scraping functions in `squashinformr`:

1. Player functions (`get_players()`, `get_player_*()`) for scraping player profile data
2. Tournament functions (`get_tournaments()`, `get_tournament_*()`) for scraping tournament results data
3. Ranking functions (`get_rankings()` & `get_historical_rankings()`) for scraping current and historical rankings tables

## Examples

### `get_player_recent_matches()`

This function returns a player's recent matches.

```{r}
library(squashinformr)

## Get Mohamed Elshorbagy's most recent match data
get_player_recent_matches(player = "Mohamed Elshorbagy", category = "mens")
```

### `get_player_rankings_history()`

This function returns player ranking histories, given their full names or current PSA ranks and competition category.  

```{r, dpi=300}
library(squashinformr)
library(ggplot2)

## Get the rankings history for the top three women's singles players
top_three <- get_player_rankings_history(rank = 1:3, category = "womens")

ggplot(top_three) +
   geom_line(aes(x = exact_date, y = rank, group = name, colour = name)) +
   scale_y_reverse() +
   theme_light() +
   labs(x = "Date", y = "Rank", colour = "Player")
```

### `get_tournament_games()`

This function returns a tournament's game results data. 

```{r}
library(squashinformr)

## Return game data for 2020's Tournament of Champions.
get_tournament_games("tournament of champions", year = 2020)
```

### `get_rankings()`

This function returns data from the most recent PSA rankings tables. 

```{r}
library(squashinformr)
library(dplyr)

## Get the top 5 players in both men's and women's singles competitions
get_rankings(top = 5, category = "both") %>%
    arrange(category, rank)
```

### `get_matchup()`

This function returns recent head-to-head matchup stats between two players. Stats returned include each player's rank, name, total matches played, number of matches won, the match results spread (relative to player 1), the average match time, the number of games played, the number of games won, average point advantage in a won game, the average point difference in final scores, the number of tie-break wins, and the percentage of games that go to a tie-breaker.

```{r}
library(squashinformr)
library(dplyr)

## Get tidy matchup stats for Paul Coll vs Diego Elias
get_matchup("Paul Coll", "Diego Elias", category = "mens", tidy = TRUE)
```
