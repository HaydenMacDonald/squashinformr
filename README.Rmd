## Disclaimer

SquashInfo is a valuable resource for the international squash community. By creating and sharing this package, I do not intend to compete with SquashInfo or any of its stakeholders. The `squashinformr` package was created to allow individuals to access data from SquashInfo in an efficient and responsible way, using <a href="https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite" target="_blank">`polite` principles</a>. Following `polite` principles incurs mandatory delays on the scraping process set by SquashInfo. This prevents the use of this package from incurring unnecessary harm to SquashInfo servers via overwhelming requests. Therefore, it is important that users are patient when using this package. SquashInfo currently offers full access to their data and extra features through a premium membership.
