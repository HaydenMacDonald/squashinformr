Politely web scrape data from <a href="http://www.squashinfo.com/" target="_blank">SquashInfo</a> in R  

## Installation

Install the development version of `squashinformr` from this GitHub repository via:

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("HaydenMacDonald/squashinformr")
```

## Usage

There are three major families of scraping functions in `squashinformr`:

1. Player functions (`get_players()`, `get_player_*()`) for scraping player profile data
2. Tournament functions (`get_tournaments()`, `get_tournament_*()`) for scraping tournament results data
3. Ranking functions (`get_rankings()` & `get_historical_rankings()`) for scraping current and historical rankings tables

## Examples



### `get_player_rankings_history()`

This function returns player ranking histories, given their full names or current PSA rankings and competition category.  

Let's contrast the ranking histories of the Mohamed Elshorbagy (Men's Rank 1 in April 2020) and Ali Farag (Men's Rank 2 in April 2020)...

```{r}
library(squashinformr)
library(ggplot2)

## Get the rankings history for the top two men's singles players
top_two <- get_player_rankings_history(player = c("Mohamed Elshorbagy", "Ali Farag"), category = "mens")

## Plot
ggplot(top_two) +
   geom_line(aes(x = exact_date, y = rank, group = name, colour = name)) +
   scale_y_reverse() +
   theme_light() +
   labs(x = "Date", y = "Rank")
```


Let's contrast the ranking histories of the current top 3 Women's players...

```{r}
library(squashinformr)
library(ggplot2)

## Get the rankings history for the top three women's singles players
top_three <- get_player_rankings_history(rank = 1:3, category = "womens")

ggplot(top_three) +
   geom_line(aes(x = exact_date, y = rank, group = name, colour = name)) +
   scale_y_reverse() +
   theme_light() +
   labs(x = "Date", y = "Rank")
```

## Disclaimer

SquashInfo is a valuable resource for the international squash community. By creating and sharing this package, I do not intend to compete with SquashInfo or any of its stakeholders. The `squashinformr` package was created to allow individuals to access data from SquashInfo in an efficient and responsible way, using <a href="https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite" target="_blank">`polite` principles</a>. Following `polite` principles incurs mandatory delays on the scraping process set by SquashInfo. This prevents the use of this package from incurring unnecessary harm to SquashInfo servers via overwhelming requests. Therefore, it is important that users of this package are patient when scraping and respectful of SquashInfo and the work they produce.
