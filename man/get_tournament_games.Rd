Given a tournament name or a year, \code{get_tournament_games()} returns match data for PSA World Tour tournaments and other events.
}
\note{
This function only returns game data from tournaments in 2019 and 2020, as any other data are not available to non-premium members on SquashInfo. Additionally, events that do not use a single elimination format are not included in the results (e.g. Karakal Premier League).
